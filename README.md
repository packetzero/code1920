## Overview

Stay sharp over winter break and learn some marketable skills.  You received some introduction to Java programming in Computer Science class.  The real world comes at you fast, and you have to be able to get the job done while learning new things at the same time.  There is no Java in this challenge, all coding will be done in Go (https://golang.org).  Go has been gaining in popularity and is touted as ‚Äúa high-level language with C-like performance‚Äù.  Here are some things you will gain exposure to:

- Go programming language (especially slices and maps)
- Visual Studio Code
- Unit tests
- command-line-fu
- Insight into DNA and Molecular Biology
